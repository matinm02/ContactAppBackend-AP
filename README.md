A comprehensive explanation

1. **ASP.NET Core Web API Project Creation**
   
   - This is the initial setup of the project in Visual Studio. I chose an ASP.NET Core Web Application with an API template, which provides a framework for creating a RESTful API.

2. **Entity Framework Core Setup**
   
   - This involves integrating Entity Framework Core, a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that enables to work with a database using .NET objects. It abstracts much of the database handling, allowing us to focus on business logic rather than data access code.

3. **Contact Model (`Contact.cs`)**
   
   - This is the data model representing a contact. It includes properties like `Id`, `FirstName`, `LastName` and `Email`. which correspond to the columns in the database.

4. **Database Context (`ContactContext.cs`)**
   
   - The `DbContext` is a part of Entity Framework Core and serves as a bridge between The application and the database. `ContactContext` inherits from `DbContext` and represents a session with the database, allowing Us to query and save data.

5. **Database Configuration (`appsettings.json` and `Startup.cs`)**
   
   - The connection string in `appsettings.json` specifies how to connect to the database.
   - In `Startup.cs`, the configuration of services like the `DbContext` and controllers is done. Here you tell ASP.NET Core how to use your `ContactContext` and where to find the database.

6. **Contacts Controller (`ContactsController.cs`)**
   
   - This controller handles HTTP requests for contacts (CRUD operations). It uses `ContactContext` to interact with the database and contains methods for each type of request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Additional Features

1. **Model Validation in `Contact.cs`**
   
   - Data annotations are used to enforce validation rules on the `Contact` model. For example, `[Required]` ensures a field is not left empty, and `[StringLength(100)]` limits a string's length.

2. **Error Handling Middleware (`ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs`)**
   
   - This middleware catches exceptions that occur in the application. It's a central place to handle errors and format them before sending the response to the client.

3. **JWT Authentication in `Startup.cs`**
   
   - The JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication setup configures your application to validate JWT tokens in incoming requests. This is crucial for protecting routes and ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities.

4. **User Registration and Login (`AuthenticationController.cs`)**
   
   - These endpoints allow users to register and log in. The registration endpoint adds new users to the database, while the login endpoint authenticates users and returns a JWT for accessing protected routes.

5. **DTOs for Registration and Login (`UserRegistrationDto.cs` and `UserLoginDto.cs`)**
   
   - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) are used to encapsulate data and send it from the client to the server. They're used here for user registration and login data.

### Understanding the Flow

- **Startup Sequence**: When the application starts, `Startup.cs` configures services and the app's request pipeline.
- **Database Interaction**: Through Entity Framework Core, your application interacts with the database using models and contexts.
- **Handling Requests**: When a request is made (e.g., to add a new contact), the relevant controller method is invoked. The controller uses `ContactContext` to interact with the database and returns a response.
- **Authentication**: JWT authentication ensures that only authenticated requests can access certain endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: The middleware catches and formats any errors that occur during request processing.
